# BigCheck

BigCheck allows you a convenient way to lookup HCP information against the Dutch BIG register. The code currently only allows you to look-up doctor based on their registration number. This might be extended in the future.

## Installation

Currently, this hasn't been released as a gem yet. For installation, you can add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'big_check', git:"https://github.com/bo-oz/big_check.git"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install big_check

## Usage

Using the gem is pretty simple. You can call the following method directly on the class:

```ruby
hcp = BigCheck::Client.check_by_big(123455)
```

This makes the call to the webservice and initializes a new object of the HCP class when there's a result. You can check validity of the result by calling the `valid?` method. If this equals to true, you can then access the available information.

```ruby
hcp.valid?
# true

# currently the following informaiton is available
hcp.birth_surname
hcp.mailing_name
hcp.prefix
hcp.initial
hcp.gender
hcp.profession
hcp.specialism
```
There's more information in the response, so you could access the raw response via:

```ruby
hcp.response
```

That's it! Enjoy.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
